# evidence_belief_models

This package implements three belief reasoners based on the multi-layer belief model introduced in [1]. The implementation builds upon and extends the original Jupyter notebook code provided in [2].

**Note:** This implementation is intended for academic and research purposes. It is not optimized for large-scale or high-performance computations.
